LayeredAspects (AroundClosure)

  (1) Code locality - (high)
    + driver code localized in only one place (QuoteDynamic) 
    + no more pointcut redefinitions
      
  (2) Reusability - (high)
      + the only one around advice (used with adviceexecution-pointcut) that intercept 
        all kinds of advice can be reused in the standard AspectJ syntax.
        
   (3) Changeability - (high)
       + all changes are localized into one place (e.g, QuoteDynamic).
        
   (4) Plugabbility - (yes)
       + only the QuoteDynamic should be removed of the build to take off the
         binding time issue.
       
   (5) Code instrumentation/overhead (low)
        + the around advice in QuoteDynamic instruments, in a generic way, all the 
          advice in the application.
          
        + since we don't have unecessary instrumentation, the execution time is reduced
          in relation to previous idioms.
